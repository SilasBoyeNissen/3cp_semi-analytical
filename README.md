This is the semi-analytical model written in MATLAB. 

Here you find a folder to generate data, and a folder to visualize data.
The generated data is saved in the folder 'generated mat-files',
and the visualized data is saved in the folder 'visualized movies'.

Three example files are already generated and visualized.
