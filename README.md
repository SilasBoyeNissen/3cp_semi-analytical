The semi-analytical model is written in MATLAB. 

Here you find a folder to generate data, and a folder to visualize data.
The generated data is saved in the folder 'generated mat-files',
and the visualized data is saved in the folder 'visualized movies'.

The only input parameter is the initial number of circles N.
One small example file is already generated and visualized.
